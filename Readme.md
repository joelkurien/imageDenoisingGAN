## Image Denoising using Generative Adversarial Network
- The main aim of this project, is to remove the grainy texture of images and provide a clear image
 with the help of suitable AI algorithms.
- Here, our group tries to solve the image denoising problem using adversarial search algorithm
 or rather generative adversarial search.
